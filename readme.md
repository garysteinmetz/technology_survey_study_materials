# Welcome to My Technology Survey Study Materials

## For now, just worry about this section

  - [Syllabus](syllabus.md)
  - [Software Installation](setup_instructions/software_installations.md)

## Goal
The goal of these study materials is to provide a survey of technology.

### Who Can Benefit
These study materials can probably help the following.

Those just wondering 'how it all works' with regards to web technologies.
Those considering a career as an application developer.
Some job openings give an edge to those with some app development understanding, this might help.
Those looking to create a web application soon and want some direction.

## Where to Start
Pick a section that interests you from the Table of Contents below that's marked `Easy`.

## How to Read These Study Materials
These study materials are written in `markdown` format. A great way to review
them is to install the `Markdown Reader` extension into Chrome and view them in Chrome
which can be done by just entering the file location of this file into the
Chrome browser's address bar (e.g. like '/Users/yourusername/Desktop/technology_survey_study_materials/readme.md'
on Mac).

Before doing that, first make sure that it can view local system files by clicking the `M` icon in the top-right,
selecting `Manage Extentions`, then enabling the `Allow access to file URLs` option. Then reload this page.

### A Great Way to Start a Project
Because tech projects have so much up-front overhead, it's easy to get overly involved in the initial setup
which can discourage you and lead to (endless?) procrastination.

A possible way to counteract that is to first dream about what the project should be and document it
in a `readme` file like this in `markdown` format. Next, define key web services between client and server
in a `swagger` document. After that, start development.
