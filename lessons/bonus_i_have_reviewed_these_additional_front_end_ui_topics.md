# Bonus: I Have Reviewed These Additional Front-End UI Topics

In software, it generally isn't good enough to get just
a basic web application to work (sometimes this is called
the 'happy path'). Covering additional features, like
having a high index on a search engine, retaining customer settings,
creating a better user experience for those with disabilities,
and supporting non-native (e.g. non-English) language experiences,
are critical to truly qualifying an application as being ready
for general public and commercial use.

## Mobile Application Development

Of course, end users don't just use a web browser to interact
with servers.

While command-line tools and software API calls can also be used
by a (technically advanced) end user to communicate with a server,
they generally use mobile applications in addition to using
web browsers.

A mobile application is an application that is downloaded
and installed as software to the cell phone.

While a company will often support _both_ web and mobile versions
for its major software application, it will support at least one.

Mobile applications have key advantages over regular web applications
in that they can more easily integrate with features of a cell
phone, like its location (GPS) and camera.

### Native Mobile Apps

Developers of native mobile apps use platform-specific languages -
like Objective C and Swift for iPhones and (historically) Java
for Android - to build them.

### Hybrid Mobile Apps

Hybrid mobile applications are mobile applications that are
created with standard web technologies - like HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. Like native mobile apps, they can easily integrate
with cell phone features.

They have the advantages and disadvantage of using "one size
fits all" technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). Advantages
include using the same technologies and maybe the same source code
repository for all flavors of the application. Disadvantages include
trying to 'shoehorn' the application to accommodate all client types
(i.e. Android, iPhone, browser) and not taking advantage of the
better stylized UI experience available to native mobile apps.

## Web Page Optimization

### SEO

### Page-Load Times


### Accessibility

### Cookies

Cookies can be set both within the web page (meta tag and JavaScript)
and also in the server's HTTP response which delivers the HTML
that the browser uses to render the web page.

#### Incognito Mode

##### Browser Fingerprinting

### Internationalization
