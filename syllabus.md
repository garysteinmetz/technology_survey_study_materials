# The Undefined Goal
There are no formal standards for software engineering. There is no licensing board.

# Duck Typing
Some programming languages allow data to be unclassified (i.e. "It's just stuff!").
To determine what data are in these cases, one can't just ask a single overall question
(e.g. "Is this a table?")
but instead asks a series of simpler questions and classifies data if all the answers
conform with the classification
(e.g. "Does it have four legs?", "Is it inert?", and "Does it have a flat surface?").

# First Class Discussion


//Overall
What are you trying to accomplish?
Who am I?
Need laptop (Windows or MacBook, but not a Chromebook or a tablet)
Lots of topics (and boring in this class)
Need buy-in of your parents/guardians
Lots of software installations (like Git, Docker, IntelliJ)
Not the video game class, but there's an emerging online framework I'm creating that could allow Simple video game creation with Phaser
There is no homework (yet), there's just one (intense but inconsequential) exam (the final), but this isn't an 'autopilot' class

//Topic for Today
Duck Typing (and its analogy to software engineering)
Text Files
Failure to Launch
